# 1.3: Cloud-based Data Warehouse

Data warehousing is moving towards cloud-based data warehousing for a variety of
reasons:
- The ability to perform complex analytical queries much faster via parallel processing
- Scalability allows massive data sets to be stored and processed
- Real time queriable data
- Allows all types of data and data latenccies, i.e. structured, semi-structured, unstructured.

## Benefits of Cloud-based Data Warehouses
- Data Access: Real-time data can be obtained via numerous sources allowing for better analytics.
- Scalability: It's much faster and less expensive to scale a cloud warehouse than an on-premise system.
- Performance: A cloud data warehouse allows for queries to be run much quicker.

## Challenges of Cloud-based Data Warehouses
- Different cost structure: The cost structure for cloud warehouses is vastly different
from traditional data warehouse costs.
- Skill shortages: There's unfortunately a lack of resources and expertise on cloud
computing and techniques whcih can become a barrier for enterprises attempting to adopt
cloud computing.
- Cloud security: Due to everything being on the cloud, data security is an extremely
important need.
- Lack of standardisation: The DWaaS (Data Warehousing as a Service) model is still
quite new and therefore lacks standardisation making it difficult to get started.
