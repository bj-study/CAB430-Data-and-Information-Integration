## Unit Description

With the rapid growth of data and digital repositories, there is an increasing awareness of benefits of data warehousing and mining techniques for Business Intelligence. Data warehousing represents an ideal vision of maintaining a central digital repository of all organizational data that can be smartly used through data mining tools to maximize business profits. Data warehousing is recognized by the IT industry as a dominant technique for applications of databases in the future. This unit discusses the concepts, architectures and methods of data warehousing and mining techniques, e.g., data warehouse architecture and schema, data cubes and OLAP (on-line analytical processing), ETL (Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading) process, data quality, association analysis and classification. It also focuses on the topics and techniques that are most promising for building and analyzing multidimensional data for efficiently organizing data warehouses and mining tools.
