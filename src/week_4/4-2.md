# OLAP Operations

## OLAP
OLAP provides a user-friendly environment for interactive data analysis. A number
of OLAP data cube operations exist to facilitate the different aggregations, allowing
for interactive querying and analysis of data at different abstract levels. For example:
- Roll up (drill up): summarize data
- Roll down (drill down): divide data
- Slice (project): choosing a single value of one dimension to generate a sub cube
with fewer dimensions
- Dice (select): choosing several values of multiple dimensions to generate a sub cube
- Pivot (rotate): rotate the data axes to generate an alternative presentation of the data
