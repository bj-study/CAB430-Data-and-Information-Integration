# Data Cubes

## Cuboids
Given a 3D cube, we can generate three 2D cubes by doing a group-by operation,
these data cubes are often called cuboids.

Given a set of dimensions we can generate a cuboid. We can also generate a cuboid
for each subset of the dimensions.

All these cuboids can form a lattice of cuboids, each showing the data for a different
level of summarization or group-by.

The bottom cuboid, also know as the base cuboid, is the largest cube holding the
lowest level of summarization. All other cuboids are called non-base cuboids.

The top cuboid, also know as the apex or 0-cube, holds the highest level of summarization.
Usually, the aggregate value of the apex cube is the sum of all values in the base cube.

## Concept Hierarchy
A dimension can be defined by a set of attributes. For example:
- Location: country, state, city, street
- Customer: name, gender, address, occupation

A dimensions attributes can be at different abstract levels. For example, street < city < state < country

A concept hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from low-level concepts to high-level,
i.e. from specific concepts to more general concepts.

The attribute hierarchy of a dimension may be organised in a partial order and sometimes
without order. For example:
- Partial order: day < {month < quarter; week} < year
- No order: customer name, gender, address, occupation
