## SELECT Statements with Mining Structures

```
SELECT [<column-list>] FROM <model-name>.CONTENT
[WHERE <condition-list>]
```

For example:
- `SELECT * FROM People1.CASES`
- Select all distinct cases in a mining structure
    - `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM MINING STRUCTURE People3.CASES`
- Select all cases as a flat rowset
    - `SELECT FLATTENED * FROM MINING STRUCTURE People3.CASES`
- `SELECT * FROM MINING STRUCTURE People3.CASES WHERE IsTestCase()`
- Select all cases with all columns
    - `SELECT * FROM [PredictGender-Tree].CASES`
- Select some cases with some conditions
    - `SELECT CustID, Gender, Age FROM [PredictGender-Tree].CASES WHERE Age > 30`
- Query using DMX functions
    - ```SQL
        SELECT DISTINCT
            Age,
            RangeMin(Age) AS [Minimum],
            RangeMid(Age) AS [Midpoint],
            RangeMax(Age) AS [Maximum]
        FROM [PredictGender-Tree]
        ```
- The DISTINCT clause allows direct reference of a column inside of a nested table
    - `SELECT DISTINCT [Purchases].Product FROM [PredictGenderNested-Tree]`
