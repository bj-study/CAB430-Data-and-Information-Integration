# Predictions

## SELECT Statement - Prediction
Predictions are used to estimate unknown information based on the results derived
from a mining model. It can either be done in batch mode or interactive mode (singleton mode):

### Batch Prediction Query
A batch prediction is a prediction for a set of cases. The input is usually a 
table which contains a set of cases and is provided by querying an external 
database or a testing set specified in the mining structure

```SQL
SELECT <column-list> FROM <mining-model>
PREDICTION JOIN <source-data-query>
ON <join-mapping-list>
```

For example:
```SQL
SELECT t.[Name], t.[Age], t.[CarModel], Predict([Gender]) AS PredictedGender
FROM [PredictGender-Tree]
PREDICTION JOIN
OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [Name], [Age], [CarModel] FROM [NewPeople]'
) AS t
ON [PredictGender-Tree].[Age] = t.[Age] AND [PredictGender-Tree].[CarModel] = t.[CarModel]
```

### Singleton Prediction Query
Prediction outcome is only for a single case. The input is a single specified 
case that is directly included in the query.

For example:
```SQL
SELECT t.[Name], t.[Age], t.[CarModel], PredictHistogram([Gender]) AS PredictionHistogram
FROM [PredictGender-Tree]
PREDICTION JOIN
OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [Name], [Age], [CarModel] FROM [NewPeople]'
) AS t
ON [PredictGender-Tree].[Age] = t.[Age] AND [PredictGender-Tree].[CarModel] = t.[CarModel]
```

## Prediction Functions
There are 2 prediction functions:
1. `Predict(<column>)`: Applies to either a scalar column or a table column.
2. `PredictHistogram(<column>)`: Only applies to a scalar column and returns a table
that represents a statistics histogram for the predicted column. This function cannot
be used for the Microsoft association algorithm.

## Natural Prediction
A natural prediction returns predictions of the input data based on the patterns
within the mining model. The column names in the mining model must match with the
column names in the input source.

It's important to note that there is no `ON` clause when using natural predictions.
It's also important to note that an error will not be thrown if the columns are not
mapped correctly.

```SQL
SELECT <column-list> FROM <model>
NATURAL PREDICTION JOIN
<source-data>
```

For example:
```SQL
SELECT t.[Name], t.[Age], t.[CarModel], Predict([Gender]) AS PredictedGender
FROM [PredictGender-Tree]
NATURAL PREDICTION JOIN
OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [Name], [Age], [CarModel] FROM [NewPeople]'
) AS t
ON [PredictGender-Tree].[Age] = t.[Age] AND [PredictGender-Tree].[CarModel] = t.[CarModel]
```
