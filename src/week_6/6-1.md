# Data Mining Concepts

## Big Data
Big data refers to data that is extremely large, complex, and fast-growing which
is difficult to manage using traditional data processing systems.

Different characteristics of big data include:
- Volume: The amount of data that needs to be analysed is huge
- Variety: The forms, format, content, etc., of data is diverse and complex
- Velocity: The speed accumulation of data is always increasing
- Veracity: The assurance of quality or credibility of the collected data is important
- Value: The value of gathered data relies on insights and knowledge derived from
the data

## Data Mining
Data mining is the process of extracting insights and patterns from large amounts 
of data. This knowledge or patterns could be:
- Valid: Hold on new data with some certainty
- Novel: New findings, not known beforehand
- Useful: Devise actions from the patterns
- Understandable: Humans can interpret and comprehend the patterns

Data mining is useful because as the data volume grows, human analysis becomes 
inadequete. Data mining is also useful as technologies that enable data exploration,
pattern discovery, and prediction can be leveraged.

Some tasks data mining is used for:
- **Pattern and association mining**: Discover patterns and associations between data
- **Clustering**: Group objects based on their similarity
- **Classification**: Build a model that distinguishes data categories/classes based
on a set of training data whose class label is known

## Data Mining Types
There are typically two types of data mining:
1. Descriptive data mining:
    - To find out what had happened based on historical data
    - To discover patterns, associations, and rules from data
    - To summarise the data with representative features
    - Typical tasks: pattern and association mining/clustering
    - They are considered as unsupervised learning methods
2. Predictive data mining:
    - To forecast what could happen based on what has happened
    - To identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on the correlations
    between items generated from the data
    - Typical predictive data mining tasks like regression and classification
    - They are considered as supervised learning methods

## Data Mining Process
1. Data pre-processing: Prepare the data for mining via:
    - Data cleaning: Remove noise and inconsistent data
    - Data integration: Combine data from multiple sources
    - Data selection: Select relevant data
    - Data transformation: Transfer or consolidate data into standard forms for mining
2. Data mining: Model construction, pattern extraction, clustering, and predicting classes
3. Evaluation: Assess the usefulness of the discovered patterns or clusters, or the correctness
of the predictions
4. Knowledge presentation: Present the mined knowledge to the user
