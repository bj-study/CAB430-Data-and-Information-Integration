# DMX - Create Data Mining Models

## DMX Statements
There are two types of DMX statements:
1. Data definition statements: 
    - Create new data mining structures and models
    - Add mining models to mining structures
    - Copy data from one mining model to another
    - Delete existing data mining structures and models
2. Data manipulation statements:
    - Search and browse data in data mining models
    - Update data mining models by insertion and updating of data
    - Generate predictions using the prediction query

## DMX Syntax

### Creating Mining Structures
```SQL
CREATE MINING STRUCTURE <structure-name> (
    <column definition list>,
)
[WITH HOLDOUT(<holdout-specifier>[OR <holdout-specifier>])]
[REPEATABLE(<holdout-seed>)]
```

where each column follows the syntax: `<column-name> <data-type> <content-type>`

A data type could be things such as a:
- long
- double
- text
- boolean
- table
- date
- etc..

A content type could be things such as a:
- key
- discrete
- continuous
- discretized
    - Discretized is the only content type which is parameterised
    - These parameters can include things like:
        - EQUAL_AREAS: Equal number of values in each group
        - CLUSTER: Find groups of values using clustering method
        - AUTOMATIC: Default, use EQUAL_AREAS with 5 groups first, if unsuccessful, use CLUSTERS
- ordered
- etc..

For example:
```SQL
CREATE MINING STRUCTURE [People] (
    [CustID]    LONG  KEY,
    [Name]      TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [Gender]    TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [Age]       LONG  CONTINUOUS,
    [AgeDisc]   LONG  DISCRETIZED(EQUAL_AREAS, 3),
    [CarMake]   TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [CarModel]  TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [Purchases] TABLE (
        [Product]   TEXT     KEY,
        [Quantity]  LONG     CONTINUOUS,
        [OnSale]    BOOLEAN  DISCRETE,
    )
    [Movie Ratings] TABLE (
        [Movie]   TEXT  KEY,
        [Rating]  LONG  CONTINUOUS,
    )
)
WITH HOLDOUT(30 PERCENT OR 10000 CASES)
```

### Add Mining Model
```SQL
ALTER MINING STRUCTURE <structure-name>
ADD MINING MODEL <model-name> (
    <column definition list>,
)
USING <algorithm-name>[(<parameter-list)]
```

where each column follows the syntax: `<column-name> <prediction>`

A prediction can either be:
- `predict`: Both input and output
- `predict_only`: Output only
- No flag: Input only

For example:
```SQL
ALTER MINING STRUCTURE [People2]
ADD MINING MODEL [PredictGender-Bayes] (
    [CustID],
    [Gender] PREDICT,
    [AgeDisc] AS [Age],
    [CarModel],
)
USING Microsoft_Naive_Bayes
```

A mining model can also be created by copying some pre-existing mining model.

```SQL
SELECT INTO [New_DecisionTree]
USING Microsoft_Decision_Trees
WITH DRILLTHROUGH, FILTER(Gender = "M" AND Age > 20)
FROM [People5_DecisionTree]
```

### Create Filters
Filters allow us to select a subset of some data to train the mining model on.

```SQL
ALTER MINING STRUCTURE [People2]
ADD MINING MODEL [FilterByAge] (
    CustID,
    Gender,
    Age,
    CarModel PREDICT,
)
USING Microsoft_Decision_Trees
WITH DRILLTHROUGH, FILTER(Gender = "M" AND age > 20)
```

### Creating a Mining Model and Mining Structure at once 
A mining model and structure can be created at the same time using the following
syntax.

```SQL
CREATE MINING MODEL <model-name> (
    <column definition list for structures>,
)
USING <algorithm-name>[(<parameter-list)]
[WITH DRILLTHROUGH]
```

The mining structures name will be the mining models name with "_Structure" being
appended.

For example, the following query will produce a mining structure called "People5_DecisionTree_Structure"
and a mining model called "People5_DecisionTree":
```SQL
CREATE MINING MODEL [People5_DecisionTree] (
    [CustID]    LONG  KEY,
    [Name]      TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [Gender]    TEXT  DISCRETE,
    [Age]       LONG  CONTINUOUS PREDICT,
    [CarModel]  TEXT  DISCRETE,
)
USING Microsoft_Decision_Trees
WITH DRILLTHROUGH
```
