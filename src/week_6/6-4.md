# Populate Models

## Populating Mining Structures
Now that we've created our structure, how can we query it? DMX provides source data
query statements, these statements are used to get access to external data sources.

It's important to note that the data source should already be created before attempting
to populate mining structures and models.

## Processing Data Mining Objects
Processing a mining structure or mining model refers to the process of creating a
training dataset and running the mining algorithm on that dataset.

`INSERT INTO` is a statement used to process mining structures and mining models.
If it's used to process a mining structure, the statment processes the mining
structure and all its associated mining models. If it's used to process a mining
model, the statment processes just the mining model.

## OPENQUERY
OPENQUERY is used to query data from an external data source and return a table.

```SQL
OPENQUERY (
    <data-source>, <query>
)
```

For example:
```SQL
OPENQUERY (
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [KEY], [Name], [Gender], [Age], [CarMake], [CarModel] FROM People'
)
```

## INSERT INTO - Structure
```SQL
INSERT INTO MINING STRUCTURE <structure-name> (
    <mapped columns>
)
<source data query>
```

<mapped columns> refers to a list of columns within the structure while <source data query>
refers to the source query to return a table which will be used to create the training
dataset.

It's important to note that the number of columns in <mapped columns> must match
with the number of columns in the table returned by the <source data query>.

For example:
```SQL
INSERT INTO MINING STRUCTURE[People1]
([CustId], [Name], [Gender], [Age], [CarMake], [CarModel])

OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [CustId], [Name], [Gender], [Age], [CarMake], [CarModel]'        
)
```

## SHAPE
SHAPE is used to query multiple data sources to create a nested table. It allows
you to combine data from multiple source into a single hierarchical table.

The queries in the statement must be ordered by columns so that they relate the
parent table and children table(s).

```SQL
SHAPE {<master-query>}
APPEND 
    (
        {<child-table-query>}
        RELATE <master-column> TO <child-column>
    ) AS <table-column-name>
```

For example:
```SQL
SHAPE {OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [KEY], [Name], [Gender], [Age], [CarMake], [CarModel] FROM People ORDER BY [Key]'
)}
APPEND 
    (
        {OPENQUERY(
            [Chapter3], 'SELECT CustID, Product, Quantity, [On Sale] FROM Purchases ORDER BY CustID'
        )} RELATE [Key] TO [CustID]
    ) AS Purchases,
    (
        {OPENQUERY(
            [Chapter3], 'SELECT CustID, Movie, Rating FROM MovieRatings ORDER BY CustID'
        )} RELATE [Key] TO [CustID]
    ) AS MovieRatings,
```

Returned by the master query:

| Key | Name | Gender | Age | CarMake | CarModel |
|-----|------|--------|-----|---------|----------|
| 1 | Anne | Female | 32 | BMW | C1 |

Returned by the first child query: Purchases

| Product | Quantity | OnSale |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Milk | 2 | False |
| Bread | 3 | True |
| Coffee | 1 | True |

Returned by the second child query: Movie Ratings

| Movie | Rating |
|---------|----------|
| Matrix | 5 |
| Show | 3 | 

## INSERT INTO - Model
```SQL
INSERT INTO MINING Model <model-name> (
    <mapped columns>
)
<source data query>
```

<mapped columns> refers to a list of columns within the model while <source data query>
refers to the source query to return a table which will be used to create the training
dataset.

For example:
```SQL
INSERT INTO MINING MODEL[PeopleClusters]
([CustId], [Name], [Gender], [Age], [CarMake], [CarModel])

OPENQUERY(
    [Chapter3], 'SELECT [Key], Name, Gender, Age, CarMake, CarModel FROM People'        
)
```

## DELETE
```SQL
DELETE FROM MINING STRUCTURE
<structure-name> | <model-name>[.CONTENT | .CASES]
```

- CONTENT: Deletes all training cases and content including it's associated mining models.
- CASES: Deletes all training cases and it's associated mining models. DRILLTHROUGH
on the associated mining model will fail however, the content of the mining model is
still intact.

## Dropping Mining Structures and Models
```SQL
DROP MINING MODEL <model-name>
DROP MINING STRUCTURE <structure-name>
```
