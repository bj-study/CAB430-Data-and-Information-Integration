# 2.3: Procedures and Functions

## Stored Procedures
A stored procedure is a batch of SQL statements that accomplish some task.
Think of them like a function in general programming terms, they can:
- Take in an optional set of parameters
- Return an optional value to display user-defined information

Stored procedures are pre-compiled and stored within the database itself. This allows
for increased performance due to not needing to be compiled every time it runs.

Stored procedures are created like so:
```SQL
CREATE PROC[EDURE] <procedure_name>
[(<@param1> <type1> [OUTPUT], <@param2> <type2>, ...)]
[WITH RECOMPILE]
AS [BEGIN] 
<sql_statements> 
[END]
```
where:
- Parameters are local variables pre-fixed with @
- Parameters are values passed from the caller
- The `OUTPUT` option indicates that the parameter is a return parameter and can
be returned to the caller
- The `WITH RECOMPILE` option forces the procedure to be re-compiled every time it's
run

For example,
```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE modify_lane (@old_lane float, @new_lane float)
AS BEGIN
    UPDATE Results
    SET Lane = @new_lane
    WHERE Lane = @old_lane
END

CREATE PROCEDURE return_counter(@old_lane float, @new_lane float, @counter INT OUTPUT)
AS BEGIN
    SELECT @counter = COUNT(*)
    FROM Results WHERE Lane = @old_lane;
    SELECT @counter AS [Quantity modified];

    UPDATE Results
    SET Lane = @new_lane
    WHERE Lane = @old_lane
END
```

The stored procedure can then be executed like so:
```SQL
EXECUTE <proc_name>
[<@param = value | @param = @variable | @param = @variable OUTPUT...>]
```

For example,
```SQL
EXECUTE modify_lane 0, 9

DECLARE @quantity_returned INT;
EXECUTE return_counter @new_lane = 9, @old_lane = 0, @counter = @quantity_returned OUTPUT;

SELECT @quantity_returned AS [Quantity returned]
```

## WITH RESULT SETS
The `WITH RESULT SETS` clause allows us to change the form of result from a stored
procedure.

For example, say we have the following stored procedure
```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE competitors_by_country (@country_code VARCHAR(25))
AS BEGIN
    SELECT GivenName, FamilyName, @country_code FROM Competitors
    WHERE CountryCode = @country_code
END
```

and we execute the following statement
```SQL
EXEC competitors_by_country 'AHO'
```

We would get the given results

| GivenName | FamilyName | (No column name) |
|--|--|--|
| Howard | Hinds | AHO |
| Tessa | Solomon | AHO |

We can alter this however using `WITH RESULT SETS`
```SQL
EXEC competitors_by_country 'AHO'
WITH RESULT SETS
    (([Given Name] VARCHAR(10),
      [Family Name] VARCHAR(10),
      [Country Code] VARCHAR(10))
    )
```

We would get the given results

| Given Name | Family Name | Country Code |
|--|--|--|
| Howard | Hinds | AHO |
| Tessa | Solomon | AHO |

## User-defined Functions
A function is a batch of SQL statements with returned values. They work similar
to how stored procedures do:
- The return value of scalar-valued functions is always a single value
- A table-valued function returns a table
- A function is stored within the database and is pre-compiled before it's stored

A function can be defined following the syntax:
```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION <function_name>
[(<@param1> <type1> [=<default_value>], <@param2> <type2>, ...)]
RETURNS {<scalar_type> | TABLE}
[AS] {BEGIN <sql_statements> END | RETURN [(]SELECT-Statement[)]}
```
where:
- The `RETURNS` clause defines the return type
- The final statement in the block must be `RETURN`

Only the following statements are allowed within the `BEGIN`/`END` block:
- Assigment statements such as `SET`
- Control-flow statements such as `FOR-loop` and `IF`
- `DECLARE` statements
- `SELECT` statements
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETED` statements

For example,
```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION average_sales()
RETURNS money
BEGIN
    DECLARE @sum money, @count INT, @average money;
    SELECT @sum = SUM(SalesYTD), @count = count(*)
    FROM Sales.SalesPerson
    SET @average = @sum/@count
    RETURN @average
END

DECLARE @average money
SET @average = dbo.average_sales()
SELECT @average AS [Average Sales]
```

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION averageSales_territory(@territoryID INT)
RETURNS money
BEGIN
    DECLARE @sum money, @count INT, @average money;
    SELECT @sum = SUM(SalesYTD), @count = count(*)
    FROM Sales.SalesPerson
    WHERE TerritoryID = @territoryID
    SET @average = @sum/@count
    RETURN @average
END

DECLARE @average money, @territory INT
SET @territoryID = 1
SET @average = dbo.averageSales_territory(@territory)
SELECT @average AS [Average Sales], @territory AS [Territory ID]
```
