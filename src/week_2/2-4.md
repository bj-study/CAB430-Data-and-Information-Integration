# 2.4: Joins

## Joins
A `JOIN` operation takes the data from two tables and combines them into a single
set of records.

There are many types of joins:
- `CROSS JOIN`
- `INNER JOIN`
- `OUTER JOIN` (Both `LEFT` and `RIGHT`)
- `FULL JOIN`

We use a `JOIN` like so:
```SQL
SELECT <select_list>
FROM <first_table> <join_type> <second_table>
[ON <join_condition>]
```

### Cross Join
A `CROSS JOIN` returns all possible combinations of two tables rows. It joins
every record on one side of the `JOIN` with every record on the other side of the
`JOIN`

```SQL
SELECT <select_list>
FROM <first_table> CROSS JOIN <second_table>
```

This can simply be shortened to

```SQL
SELECT <select_list>
FROM <first_table> , <second_table>
```

Note: A `CROSS JOIN` has no `ON` operator

Due to a cross join performing a cartesian product operation, the resulting table
is called a 'product table'. It's also because of this cartesian product operation
that cross joins are considered inefficient.

### Inner Join
An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows from the joined tables that satisfy a join
condition without generating a cartesian product table.

```SQL
SELECT <select_list>
FROM <first_table> INNER JOIN <second_table>
ON <join_condition>
```

For example,
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.Events INNER JOIN dbo.Results
ON dbo.Events.EventId = dbo.Results.EventId
```

### Outer Join
An `OUTER JOIN` is an inclusive operation where what specifically gets included
depends on which side the join is taking place on.

A `LEFT OUTER JOIN` includes all records from the table on the left, while a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
includes all recrods from the table on the right.

```SQL
SELECT <select_list>
FROM <left_table>
<LEFT|RIGHT> [OUTER] JOIN <right_table>
ON <join_condition>
```

For example,
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM dbo.Events
LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.Results
ON dbo.Events.EventId = dbo.Results.EventId
```

### Full Join
A `FULL JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN`, is a join where everything on both sides
gets included.
